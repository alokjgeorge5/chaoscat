## Project Description

ChaosCat is a playful Godot project that brings a pixel-art cat to life with smooth animations and dynamic backgrounds. The cat responds to user input, making the experience interactive and visually engaging.

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Why do cats in games always get boring, static backgrounds and stiff animations? ChaosCat fixes this by giving your digital feline the attention it deserves!

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)

By combining pixel-perfect sprite animations with a looping, dynamic background, ChaosCat ensures your digital cat feels alive‚Äîeven when it‚Äôs just chillin‚Äô.
